-> To run gradle task without printing task names and only the task outputs
    * gradle -q taskA  (here -q means quiet)

-> mustRunAfter property
    * we can specify the order in which the task can be executed
    * but i wont kick start the task that has to be done first, we have mention it
    * but if there is a dependency b/w the task then tasks will excute in the order, without explicit mentioning
    * it will fail for the circular dependency
-> shouldRunAfter property
    * same as mustRunAfter property
    * one diff -> it will ignore the circular dependency

-> finalizedBy property
    * if task1.finalizedBy task2 then it make sures that task2 is running after the task1
