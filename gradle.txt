-> gradle have tasks
------------------------
1. lifecycle 
2. properties
3. actions
4. dependencies


-> building  a project phases
-----------------------------------
1. initialization phase -> (multiple projects will use it to build the phases)
2. configuration phase
3. excution phase

-> ext - extra properties
ext {
    var1 = 10
}
variables used in ext can accessed in other/child build scripts also
we can apply a build.gradle to another gradle file by writing - apply from: "build.gradle"
so that we can use all the ext properties and tasks defined in the build.gradle

commands
-----------------------------------
-> to see all tasks from build.gradle file
    * gradle tasks --all
-> run particular task from build.gradle file
    * gradle TaskName
